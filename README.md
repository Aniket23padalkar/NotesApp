## Description

I built multiple versions of this project and rewrote the code multiple times just to practice and understand things better.  
Here I decided to upload only two versions — **Beginner** and **Advanced**.

While building this, I started with a simple modal design and kept adding features step by step with vanilla JavaScript.  
By the time I saw the final product, I was honestly shocked — this didn’t feel like a “mini project” anymore.  
It felt great to see how much I had learned along the way.

-   **JavaScript** (Vanilla)

## Final Thought

I made both versions live so they’re easy to try out.  
Personally, I really like how the mobile version turned out — it’s fully responsive, and the input popout feels like a modern app.  
This project was a huge confidence boost for me.
