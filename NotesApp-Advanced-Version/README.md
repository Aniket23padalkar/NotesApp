# NotesApp - Advanced Version

## Live Demo

[NotesApp-Advanced-Version](https://aniket23padalkar.github.io/NotesApp/NotesApp-Advanced-Version/)

## Description

In this version, I made a **big improvement** by using a **single modal** for both adding and editing notes.  
Earlier, I had **3 separate modals**, but I wanted to **clean up the JavaScript** and make it more efficient.

This project was already kind of “advanced by accident,” but here I tried to make my **JavaScript logic cleaner and more advanced**.

## Features

-   Add, edit, and delete notes
-   Categories: **All, Pinned, Work, Personal**
-   Real-time search & category filters
-   **Dark/Light mode** (saved in `localStorage`)
-   Notes stored in `localStorage`
-   Live counters for each category
-   Unique colors for each category
-   Fully responsive across almost all devices

## Tech Stack

-   **HTML**
-   **CSS**
-   **JavaScript (Vanilla)**

## Challenges I Faced

-   Getting **edit functionality** right was the hardest part.  
    It broke a few times, but solving it taught me a lot about DOM updates and state management.

## Final Thoughts

This version focuses on **refactoring** and **writing cleaner JavaScript**.  
Since I already explained the basics in the previous version, this README and the detailed file focus more on **advanced updates and logic improvements**.
