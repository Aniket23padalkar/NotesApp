# NotesApp – Beginner Version

## Live Demo

[NotesApp Beginner Version]()

---

## Description

A simple yet feature-rich **Notes App** built with **vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**.  
This was one of my **first big projects**, and I’m proud that it’s also fully **responsive**.

I actually started this project **accidentally in my early learning stage** — I just designed a basic layout from scratch and kept adding features one by one. Through this, I learned a lot about **DOM manipulation, localStorage, and managing state in JavaScript**.

## Features

-   Add, edit, and delete notes
-   Categories: All, Pinned, Work, Personal
-   Real-time search & filters
-   Dark/Light mode (saved in localStorage)
-   Notes stored locally with localStorage
-   Live counters for each category
-   Unique colors for every category
-   Responsive across almost all devices

## Tech Stack

-   HTML
-   CSS
-   JavaScript (Vanilla)

## Challenges I Faced

-   Making a **search bar pop out on smaller screens**, like in big websites.
-   Getting **edit functionality** right — it was tricky but taught me a lot.

## Final Thoughts

I had **no idea** this would become such a big project.  
It started with a simple design I made myself, but I kept building on it step by step.  
When I finished, I realized I had built something pretty advanced for an early-stage project!

This project gave me **a ton of confidence and learning**. In the next version, I focused on cleaning and shortening the code even more.
